# Token Registry

This repo contains a `token-registry.json` for a number of tokens on Kujra chain and dedicated information.  It contains data that makes it easy to display, render and fetch on UI and if available, complemented with CoinGecko's information.

Schema files containing the recommended metadata structure can be found in the `registry.schema.json` files located in the root directory and a template is available on `template.json`.

## APIs (Soon to be confimed)
- Public access API serving the above denoms should be added in the near future.

## Contributing

Pull requests are very much accepted to add data to `token-registry.json` both for adding new assets or complementing/rectifing asset information.

Please give Pull Requests a title that describes the change/es in a more optimal manner than default titles. Some recommended details would be: the affected token, values, etc. to give some more detail; e.g., "Add tokens XXX and YYY. Update ZZZ info.".
